#Python仍然会忽略上句代码，但是它却可以作为“黑客”或者解决问题的方法来制定文件的格式。你还可以
#在编辑器的设置中找到其他类似的注释。
# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."

print "This will run."
